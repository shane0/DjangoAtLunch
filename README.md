# DjangoAtLunch
Simple Django app to let people know you're at lunch or on vacation.

To use you add users in the built in admin console.

Users have one view where they can check in or out with a timestamp and leave a text message for others.

This was developed for a few medical offices in Eastern Iowa, used internally by trusted staff.
